## Description

Students of Javascript often find it hard to remember fundamental concepts â€” this app's gamification is designed to help them grasp such concepts and remember them better after completing each game.

I made this app to illustrate the importance of dynamic DOM manipulation via Javascript.

While making this app, I learned about JSON parse and stringify.
